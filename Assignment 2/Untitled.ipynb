You decided to help her: she has a special smartphone for blind people, and you are going to develop a mobile phone app that can do _machine vision_ using the mobile camera: converting a picture (from the camera) to the meaning of the image. You decide to start with an app that can read handwritten digits, i.e. convert an image of handwritten digits to text (e.g. it would enable her to read precious handwritten phone numbers).\n",

Since hand-coding this function is highly non-trivial, you decide to solve this problem using machine learning, such that the internal parameters of this function are automatically learned using machine learning techniques.\n",
